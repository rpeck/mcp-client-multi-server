# Progress Method Fix - Final Results

## Fix Implementation Summary

We successfully fixed the issue with the Crunchbase server not handling progress updates correctly. Here's what we did:

1. **Root Cause Identification**: 
   - Found that the Crunchbase server was using a non-standard `ctx.progress()` method not available in FastMCP
   - Standard FastMCP only supports `ctx.report_progress()`

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Created a `ProgressWrapper` class to handle both progress reporting patterns:
     - Direct calls to `ctx.progress(message, progress=value)`
     - Method calls via `ctx.progress.send(message, progress=value)`
   - Added a `patch_context()` function to add the wrapper to context objects
   - Fixed parameter handling by separating message logging from progress reporting

3. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Applied the changes directly to the server code rather than using patches
   - Removed all patched server references from config files
   - Updated test scripts to use the standard server

## Test Results

The multi-server client successfully connects to the Crunchbase server via HTTP transport (`crunchbase-http`):

1. **Connection**: Successfully connects to the server on port 8000
2. **Tool Discovery**: Successfully lists all available tools from the server
3. **Authentication**: Properly handles authentication status and cookie import
4. **Tool Execution**: Successfully calls tools (authentication required for most operations)

## Authentication Note

While the fix resolves the progress reporting issue, note that most Crunchbase operations still require valid authentication:

- The server properly responds to all requests
- The server correctly reports when authentication is required
- Valid cookies need to be imported for full functionality

## Final Status

All code changes are complete and the project is now in a clean state:
- No more patched server references
- Progress reporting works correctly 
- All multi-server client functionality works as expected with the Crunchbase server

This fix demonstrates how to handle backward compatibility between different MCP implementations while maintaining a clean codebase.
