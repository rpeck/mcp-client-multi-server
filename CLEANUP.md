# MCP Multi-Server Client - Codebase Cleanup

## Development Files Cleanup

The following untracked development and ephemeral files were removed to clean up the repository:

1. **Development Tools**
   - `direct_progress_test.py` - Testing utility for progress reporting functionality
   - `launch_stop_test.py` - Basic server launch/stop test script (functionality covered by test suite)
   - `progress_event_monitor.py` - Utility for monitoring progress events

2. **Redundant Utilities**
   - `list_tools.py` - Simple utility script with functionality available through CLI

3. **Example Scripts with Potential Sensitive Data**
   - `crunchbase_example.py` - Example script for Crunchbase integration, potentially containing credentials
   - `transport_with_cookies.py` - Example of transport with cookie authentication

4. **Migration and Test Scripts**
   - `report_progress_migration.py` - One-time migration script
   - `restart_server.py` - Development utility for server restart testing

## Rationale

These files were removed because:

1. They contained functionality that has been integrated into the main codebase
2. They were one-time use development scripts
3. They might have contained sensitive information or credentials
4. Their functionality was redundant with the test suite
5. They were not intended to be part of the public API

## Related Test Coverage

The functionality in the removed scripts is properly covered by the test suite:

- Server launch/stop functionality is covered in `tests/test_server_lifecycle.py`
- Progress reporting is covered in appropriate transport tests
- Authentication functionality is tested in the relevant integration tests

This cleanup was performed on May 16, 2025.
